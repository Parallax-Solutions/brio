## Why This Product Exists

The Costa Rica Multi-Currency Budget App exists to solve the financial management challenges faced by individuals and families living in Costa Rica who deal with multiple currencies in their daily financial lives.

## Who It Is For

This app is designed for:
- **Expatriates and digital nomads** living in Costa Rica who earn or spend in multiple currencies (CRC, USD, CAD)
- **Costa Rican residents** who have international financial obligations (e.g., Canadian phone bills, USD investments)
- **Families** managing household budgets across currency boundaries
- **Anyone** who needs to track income and expenses in multiple currencies with accurate conversion tracking

## Core Problems It Solves

1. **Multi-Currency Complexity**: Managing budgets when income and expenses span multiple currencies (CRC, USD, CAD) without losing track of actual spending power.

2. **Recurring Payment Tracking**: Keeping track of recurring bills (rent, insurance, phone bills) that may be in different currencies and due on different schedules.

3. **Variable Expense Management**: Tracking bills that change monthly (utilities, internet) and ensuring nothing is missed.

4. **Income Planning**: Supporting multiple income sources with different cadences (monthly salary, biweekly freelance, one-time payments) and currencies.

5. **Exchange Rate Tracking**: Maintaining historical exchange rates for accurate budget analysis and conversion calculations.

6. **Budget Visibility**: Providing a clear dashboard view of:
   - Expected vs. received income
   - Total expenses by category and currency
   - Remaining budget
   - Upcoming and overdue payments

7. **Financial Clarity**: Converting all financial data to a base currency (CRC) for unified budget analysis while preserving original currency amounts for accuracy.
